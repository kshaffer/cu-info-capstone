### Overview ###

In this course, you will have an opportunity to demonstrate the culmination of your learning in the major by designing and implementing a significant information system or developing a research question, typically in response to a problem of personal interest related to or informed by their secondary area of specialization. This course will engage you in project planning, public presentation, and reflecting on the social and ethical implications of your projects.

### Course description ###

Provides senior level INFO students an opportunity to demonstrate the culmination of their learning in the major by designing and implementing a significant information system or developing a research question, typically in response to a problem of personal interest related to or informed by their secondary area of specialization. Reinforces project planning, public presentation and ethic skills.

### Course goals ###

- Design, propose, iterate, and present a project that builds on your interests and what you have learned in Information Science and CU
- Collaborate with a team of students to develop and manage the course project
- Learn about opportunities that exist to extend and expand on the practices and activities in this class within and beyond CU


## The project ##

In the early weeks of the course, students and instructor will negotiate a collaborative research project that builds on existing work in the field of information science.

The capstone project is the central activity of this course. The project is an opportunity to bring together what you’ve learned during your time in Information Science and elsewhere at CU–Boulder. You are welcome to build on your interests and skills, but the project must be a new exploration (rather than building on an existing project or pairing it with another project from a different course). The capstone project is also a collaborative project of 3–4 students. 

You can pursue three kinds of projects: 

- Design: Prototype a system to explore a new possibility. Likely deliverables include wireframes, mockups, a sales deck, and/or a business plan.
- Build: Implement a tool to address a need. Likely deliverables will constitute a minimal viable product (MVP), a working prototype, or a set of proof-of-concept software implementations.
- Research: Frame an investigation to examine a question. Likely deliverables include a research paper, a public website, and/or a presentation.

I advise that you choose a project type that fits your interests and skills, and that also aligns with your career goals. Ideally, the project will be something that you can build a public portfolio around, or otherwise highlight in the interview process, or — in rare but exciting cases — build a new business around.


## Credit and assessment ##

Because the course is based around a single large collaborative project, we will use a form of *contract grading*.

Assessment will take place in reference to the three course goals, listed above, and additional criteria that you create in conjunction with your collaborators and under my advisement and approval.

All students will propose a course contract soon after the collaborative research project has been decided. This contract will articulate the grade desired and layout a work plan that is appropriate for your interests, intended field, project type, and desired grade. Once approved by the instructor, these contracts will bind you to the work laid out. However, amendments to the contracts can be requested in writing, as long as it is well in advance of the relevant course deadlines. Students who fail to meet the requirements of their contract will receive a C if the instructor believes the student has completed a project and otherwise demonstrated sufficient mastery of the course goals listed above, or a D or F, if the project is not completed and/or those goals are not met. Students who meet the requirements of their contract will receive the grade listed on the contract.

Attendance in this class is absolutely essential, particularly for your collaborative efforts. I will only approve contracts that include a plan for regular attendance and participation in class, including your attendance, preparation, and participation in class meetings that precede the approval of the contract. 

There is no final exam. All assessment will take place in reference to course contracts.

## Required materials ##

- An account for the class's [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel. (We will set this up during the first day of class.)

All other required class materials will be posted or linked to on the course GitHub repository.

## Suggested materials ##

- A free [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com) account *using your CU Identikey*.  
- A free [GitHub](http://github.com) account.  

## Policies ##

For instructor and university policies relevant to this course, please see [this page](policies.md).

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

I absolutely expect that you will use AI tools in this course. In fact, it is essential as graduates of the Information Science program that you have experienced with AI tools, as well as a sophisticated, nuanced, and thoughtful approach to their use, non-use, and the ethical implications of their use. Hiring managers also expect that you will have experience with AI tools, and that you will be able to use them effectively in your work. We will discuss their use as the course progresses, and I expect not only that they will play some role in your project, but that some major update or development will happen in the course of the semester that will require you to adapt your project and/or our class approach to those new developments. I have developed AI tools, I use generative AI almost daily, and I have given presentations and led workshops on the ethical use of AI in information science and in education. If you have any questions about their utility, safety, or ethical implications, or if you just want to shoot the breeze about new, exciting, and or scarp developments in the field, let's talk!
