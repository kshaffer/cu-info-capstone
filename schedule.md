## Week 5: Thursday, September 18

### Prep

#### Project work

Concretely define your intended project deliverable. _This will likely change as you work on it_, but you should have a clear idea of what you intend to deliver. This can take the form of a paragraph, a set of bullet points, or a more elaborate product roadmap in an Agine project management tool. It should describe the overall deliverable, and the key components you have identified so far. For example, if your project is an analytics dashboard, you would describe the key features of the dashboard, and then identify core components such as a web scraper, a database, a backend API, and a frontend interface. If you have a sense of who in your group will be responsible for which components, include that as well.

Submit the document, or a link to your online resource, via a Slack DM or group channel that includes me and all members of your group. 

#### Read/watch

## Week 6: Thursday, September 25

### Prep

Submit your first draft of your course contract via email and/or a Slack DM to me. Make a copy of the [course contract template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r_lSsCOOOsTkdgjfxWKuN0xG0ROB4YbC32SKjd0RfMQ/edit?usp=sharing) and fill it out as specific to your project. Share it with me by the beginning of class on the 25th. _This contract will not be in force until I give you written approval._ Keep in mind that it may take a little back-and-forth to get it right, so after you submit the first draft, keep an eye on the document or your notifications, so we can work out all details over the next week or so. 

Continue work on your project with your team.
